#  Social Media User Behavior Analysis & Modeling

##  Project Overview
This mini-project focuses on analyzing and modeling **social media user behavior** using data-driven approaches. The goal is to uncover engagement patterns, classify users based on activity, and predict future behavior using machine learning models.

##  Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand user activity and interactions.  
- Identify **key behavioral indicators** such as posting frequency, likes, and comments.  
- Build **predictive models** to classify user behavior.  
- Apply **clustering techniques** to segment users into groups.  
- Derive insights for understanding user engagement patterns.  

##  Dataset
- The dataset contains user activity metrics such as number of posts, likes, comments, and engagement levels.  
- Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.  

##  Methodology
1. **Data Exploration** – Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis with visualizations.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Creation of engagement ratios and behavioral metrics.  
3. **Clustering** – K-Means and PCA for segmenting users into meaningful groups.  
4. **Predictive Modeling** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for behavior classification.  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  

##  Results & Insights
- Posting frequency and engagement ratio are strong predictors of user activity.  
- Clustering revealed distinct user segments such as:  
  - **Highly Engaged Users**  
  - **Casual Users**  
  - **Passive Observers**  
- Machine learning models achieved good performance, with **Random Forest and XGBoost** outperforming baseline models.  

##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates how analyzing social media data can provide valuable insights into user engagement patterns. Predictive models and clustering approaches allow us to classify and segment users effectively.  

While this is a mini-project, it highlights the potential of data-driven strategies for understanding online communities. Future improvements may include adding sentiment analysis, time-series modeling, and deployment via an interactive dashboard.  

##  Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** (EDA & preprocessing)  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML models & evaluation)  
- **XGBoost** (advanced modeling)  

##  Future Work
- Incorporating **text sentiment analysis** for deeper insights.  
- Exploring **time-based trends** in user activity.  
- Deploying results via a **Streamlit/Dash app**.
